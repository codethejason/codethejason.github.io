      <h2>About</h2>
      <p id="meDescription">Iâ€™m currently a college senior studying at Johns Hopkins University
        studying computer science and neuroscience.
        I'm looking to explore my interests in software engineering,
        data science, and computational neuroscience. As well as working on
        school and hackathon projects, I occasionally contribute and maintain
        open-source projects. I enjoy learning all the time, whether it be new
        programming languages like Haskell or experimenting with flavors in
        Asian-American fusion cuisine. My eyes are set on research
        breakthroughs, especially regarding autonomous vehicles and further understanding of the brain.</p>
